		<p>	 Each infographic can be customized to fit your website design using an interface and you don't need any coding. The code tells us which pictures we want to 
		display. It also tells us the size of the pictures. 
			When we insert the @media screen it allows the other pictures to pop up. As soon as we take that code out there will only be one picture that shows up. The infographics allow us to see whch pictures change at certain sizes. An example would be infographic_small, as soon as I took that code out the pictures didnt change when I made the width smaller. These infographics are visual representations of data.</body>
